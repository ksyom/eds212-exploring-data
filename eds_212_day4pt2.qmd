### Exploratory Data Viz

Check out your data a bit:

Remember that typing view(penguins) in the console or code chunk will bring up the data frame for you to view the data

in Quarto:
putting #| warning in the opening code chunk: false makes it refrain from printing the warnings
putting #| echo in the opening code chunk: false prevents it from printing the code 

Similar capabilities in RMarkdown but different code

```{r}
#| include: false

# tell me the column nmaes
names(penguins)

#tell me the dimensions?
dim(penguins)
#Can you show me the first six lines?
head(penguins)
#Can you show me the last 6 lines?
  tail(penguins)
```

#| include: false in a code chunk makes the chunk not show up bc it's not being included
